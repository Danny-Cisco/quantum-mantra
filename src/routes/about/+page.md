# Quantum Mantra

So I like Transcendental Meditation... It helps me with my ADHD a lot, but the whole process where you supposedly pay money to get your mantra assigned... Come on... it always seemed phony to me. So when I started out, I found some tutorials that reccomended I just chose my own word. This word is called your "mantra" but surprisingly, the most effective thing when chosing your mantra, is that it should be a purely meaningless word. I chucked a few syllables together and eventually chose something. I was confident it meant nothing to me:

## "Ah-NOO-nah"

And it works great! If I spend 20 mins saying "Ah-NOO-nah" to myself, I am able to sink into a transcendental state, sinking below my thoughts, resetting my dopamine-seeking behavior, and regaining agency and control. For a brief time after a TM session it feels like...

## Will-power is set to easy-mode

Its been quite a few years now, and I'm slipping out of my practice. Maybe I'm getting tired of my mantra? So I thought, why not produce a new nonsense word for every session? But to give it a little spice... why not let the quantum multiverse find me the most random of random words I could ever conjure up? So the idea for Quantum-Mantra was born

Hopefully, it removes a barrier to somebody trying transcendental meditation. Really, the name "Transcendental" is intimidating; I would prefer to call it "Nothing Word" meditation.

Why does it work? Well, just like focussing on your breathing, I think that your inner dialogue has a similar quality, in that while it CAN be controlled consciously, it's not necessary to do so... so when you meditate on your breath, you are focusing your mind on a pointless task, which is easier than trying to focus on nothing. When you repeat a "nothing word" with your inner voice, it's another way of tieing up your thoughts with a pointless task. And if you can keep doing it for 20 mins, your conscious mind will realize how unnecessary your conscious thoughts actually are, and your ego will begin to let go.

In transcendental meditation, the goal is to visualise your thoughts as waves on the surface of a deep ocean. As you progress through the meditation, you should not be concerned with calming your thoughts (the waves) but instead, sinking beneath them, leaving the waves behind, and submerging into the depths below, where your thoughts always calm.

If you choose to believe there is some quantum magic to the mantras on this site, well... It doesn't hurt... quantum numbers feel softer to me... but hey... I could just be imagining it. But for now, when people ask me what sort of word do I choose, I can just point them here.

Happy Dreaming,
